FTP functionality plus some advanced features like resuming, fxp, SSL/TLS encryption, 
large file support, or logging to fit todays standards.

## Documentation

ftplibpp provides a c++ class providing ftp client functionality. It supports all basic FTP functionality plus some 
advanced features like resuming, fxp, SSL/TLs encryption, large file support, or logging to fit todays standards. The 
very base of ftplibpp is Thomas Pfau's [ftplib c library](http://nbpfaus.net/%7Epfau/ftplib/).

Every FTP session is represented by an ftplib object, whose methods are called to communicate with the FTP server. The 
FTP sessions should begin with a call to *myftp.Connect("myftp.org")* (and maybe *myftp.NegotiateEncryption()* ), be 
followed with *myftp.Login("myuser","mypass")* and ended by *myftp.Quit()*. For the magic in between, read the class 
methods documentation. Most methods have their tasks pretty much explained in their name. ftplibpp uses OpenSSL for 
encryption functionality, if you don't need it you can set the "NOSSL" flag (e.g. *g++ -c ftplib.cpp -DNOSSL* ). If your 
system does not feature large file support (or does not need specific LFS functions, because it's built in yet) you can 
use the "NOLFS" flag (e.g. g++ -c ftplib.cpp -DNOLFS* ).

####Returns: 

Returns 1 if successful and 0 if the ssl negotiation failed. 

####Notes: 

The ftplibpp library uses an ssl/tls encryption approach defined in the RFC4217 standard.

<a name="quit" />

###void Quit ()

<a name="setcallbackxferfunction" />

###void SetCallbackXferFunction ( FtpCallbackXfer pointer )

When SetCallbackBytes is set to a bigger value than 0, a callback function can be called during an FTP data transfer. If 
the callback function returns 0, the data transfer is aborted. The callback function has two parameters: *xfered* & *arg*. 
*xfered* is the amount of bytes yet transfered during the data connection and *arg* contains either NULL or a custom 
pointer set by [SetCallbackArg](#setcallbackarg). If *pointer* is specified as NULL the xfer callback is disabled. 

####Parameters: 

*pointer:* A pointer to a static function of the type FtpCallbackXfer. 

####Notes: 

Since FtpCallbackXferFunction only accepts pointers to static functions, it might appear problematic in an oo c++ context. 
However there's an easy way to use it anyway. Using SetCallbackArg you supply the class a pointer to the object the method
of which you'd like to call from the ftplib object. That pointer is then passed back with call to the callback function. 
From the static callback function you can perform a cast of *arg* to a pointer of the your desired object, and call its 
method. valid code could look like this:

```cpp
...
static int callback(off64_t xfered, void* arg); // static callback function defined in myclass.h 
void mymethod(off64_t xfered); // common myclass method
...
int myclass::callback(off64_t xfered, void* arg) {
  ((*myclass)(arg))->mymethod(xfered); // casting the pointers to the correct type and calling class method 
  return 1; 
}
...
void myclass::mymethod() {
  DoSomething();
}
...
myftp.SetCallbackArg(this); // supply the myftp object the pointer to the current (myclass) object
myftp.SetCallbackBytes(1024); // issue a xfer callback every kb 
myftp.SetCallbackXferFunction(class::callback); 
...
```
<a name="setcallbacklogfunction" />

###void SetCallbackLogFunction ( FtpCallbackLog pointer ) 

SetCallbackLogFunction() enables the logging callback. Every time there's been data read from the control connection, 
*pointer* is called with a c-styled string and a custom pointer specified in [SetCallbackArg](#setcallbackarg). If 
*pointer* is specified as *NULL* logging callback is disabled. 

####Parameters: 

*pointer:* A pointer to a static function of the type [FtpCallbackLog](#ftpcallbacklog).

####Notes:

See SetCallbackIdleFunction.

<a name="setcallbackcertfunction" />

###bool SetCallbackCertFunction ( FtpCallbackCert pointer )

SetCallbackCertFunction() enables the ssl/tls certification callback. When you use encryption and you call this method
with a certification callback function, it is called when connecting to the server. In the callback function you decide 
via the boolean return value whether the certificate is valid or not. Certification checking is an advanced issue, and 
you should read into the openssl documentation if you plan to implement it. *pointer* is called with a custom pointer 
specified in [SetCallbackArg](#setcallbackarg) and the certificate from the Server. If pointer is specified as *NULL* 
certification callback is disabled. 

####Parameters: 

*pointer:* a pointer to a static function of the type [FtpCallbackCert](#ftpcallbackcert).

####Notes: 

Sample implementation:
```cpp
bool MyCallbackCert(void *arg, X509 *cert) { 
  if (cert == NULL) { 
    printf("Peer sent no certificate.\n"); 
    return false;
  } else { 
    char peer_CN[265]; 
    int len; 
    X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(X509_get_subject_name(cert), NID_commonName, peer_CN, 256); 
    printf("subject: %s\n", peer_CN); 
    X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(X509_get_issuer_name(cert), NID_commonName, peer_CN, 256);
    printf("issuer: %s\n", peer_CN); return true; 
  } 
} 
```
###void SetCallbackIdleFunction ( FtpCallbackIdle pointer )

SetCallbackLogFunction() enables the idle callback. When a connection idles, for a period bigger than 0 set in 
[SetCallbackIdletime](#setcallbackidletime) a callback to the argument function is issued.

####Parameters: 

*pointer:* A pointer to a static function of the type [FtpCallbackIdle](#ftpcallbackidle). 

####Notes: 

See SetCallbackXferFunction.

<a name="setcallbackarg" />

###void SetCallbackArg ( void* arg )

SetCallbackArg submits a pointer of custom type to the object, this pointer is returned with a callback function. A good
idea is to store the ftplib owners (or whatever object should handle the callback) pointer in it to use it the way 
described in the [SetCallbackXferFunction](#setcallbackxferfunction) entry.

####Parameters:

*arg:* A pointer of a custom type.

<a name="setcallbackbytes" />

###void SetCallbackBytes ( off64_t bytes ) 

SetCallbackBytes specifies the frequency of xfer callbacks. The xfer callback returns the amount of bytes yet transfered 
on this transfer.

####Parameters: 

*bytes:* Specifies the frequency in transfered bytes. A value of 100000 would mean every 100000 bytes an xfer callback is 
issued.

<a name="setcallbackidletime" />

###void SetCallbackIdletime ( int time )

SetCallbackIdletime specifies how long a data socket can idle, without an idle callback beeing issued.

####Parameters: 

*time:* Time in msec. 

####Notes:

The default value of 0, means that on every idle a callback happens. if you don't want this behaviour you have to set a
(higher) value.

<a name="setconnmode" />

###void SetConnmode ( ftplib::ftp mode )

SetConnmode specifies which data connection method is to be used for the next data transfer.

####Parameters: 

*mode:* Either ftplib::pasv (passive mode, default) or ftplib::port (active mode).

<a name="setcorrectpasv" />

###void SetCorrectPasv ( bool b )

Some Ftp-Servers, which run behind a NAT, return their local ip-adresses as PASV replies. When this option is turned on 
PASV replies are corrected using the ip address the FTP session is currently connected to. 

####Parameters:

*b:* true turns the correction on, false turns it off.

<a name="fxp" />

###int Fxp ( ftplib* src, ftplib* dst, const char *pathSrc, const char *pathDst, ftplib::ftp mode, ftplib::ftp method )

[static]

Fxp is a static function. Tt uses two FTP session objects and transfer a certain file between them. 

####Parameters: 

*src:* Source ftplib object.
*dst:* Destination ftplib object.
*pathSrc:* Path to file to be copied copy ("/incoming/myfile.tar.gz").
*pathDst:* Path to file destination ("/pub/myfile_from_some_ftp.tar.gz"); 
*mode* Either *ftplib::ascii* (ascii) or *ftplib::image* (binary). Method either *ftplib::defaultfxp* (PASV on dst, PORT 
on src) or *ftplib::alternativefxp* (PASV on src, PORT on dst).

####Returns: 

Returns 1 if successful, -1 if initilization failed ("PORT" and "PASV"), or 0 if the data transfer somehow failed. 

####Notes:

Fxp - direct Ftp to Ftp transfer - is rather an exploit than a feature and might thus be prevented by many servers. 
Currently Fxp does not work with encrypted data connections, so be sure to switch to unencrypted data channels before 
performing fxp.

<a name="rawread" />
###ssize_t RawRead ( void* buf, size_t max, ftphandle *handle )

RawRead copies up to max bytes of data from the specified data connection and returns it to the user's buffer. If the data
connection was opened in ascii mode, no more than one line of data will be returned.
